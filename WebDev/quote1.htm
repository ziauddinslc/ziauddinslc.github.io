      Winston Churchill had said: <q cite="">Success is the ability to go from one failure to another with no loss of enthusiasm.</q>
    </p>
    <p> This is a longer quote taken from <cite> The Picture of Dorian Gray</cite> by <em> Oscar Wilde</em>:</p>
    <blockquote cite="">
      Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter.
      The sitter is merely the accident, the occasion. It is not he who is revealed by the painter;
      it is rather the painter who, on the coloured canvas, reveals himself. The reason I will not exhibit this picture is that I am afraid that
      I have shown in it the secret of my own soul.
