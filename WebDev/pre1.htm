    <h2>A poem by Ariel Dorfman</h2>
    <pre>
    When they tell you
    I’m not a prisoner
    Don’t believe them
    When they tell you
    They released me
    Don’t believe them
    They’ll have to admit it’s a lie
    Someday
    And finally
    When the day comes
    When they ask you to identify the body
    And you see me
    And a voice says
    We killed him…
    He’s dead
    When they tell you
    That I am completely, absolutely, definitely dead
    Don’t believe them
    Don’t believe them
    Don’t believe them
